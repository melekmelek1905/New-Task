                <p style="font-family: East Sea Dokdo;">Slipknot is an American heavy metal band from Des Moines, Iowa. Slipknot has eight members in the band. The current band members are Sid Wilson, Jim Root, Craig Jones, Shawn Crahan, Mick Thomson, Corey Taylor, Alessandro Venturella and Jay Weinberg. The first bassist from Slipknot, Paul Gray, died from an accidental drug overdose in 2010. Also, Joey Jordison was forced to leave the band. He is now working on his own projects. The surviving band members wear masks. Percussionist Chris Fehn also left the band due to suing band mates Shawn Crahan and Corey Taylor for allegedly duping him out of money in 2019. The band has sold almost 15 million records worldwide.</p>
